## Check In-store Stock for Swatch Watches

To check the in-store stock for Swatch watches, you can use the following URL pattern:
```
https://www.swatch.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-swarp-EU-Site/it_IT/InStorePickup-Store?sid=STORE_ID&pid=PRODUCT_ID
```

- `STORE_ID` is the identifier for the specific store.

```
In this case, `R012039` is the Store ID.

### Getting the Product ID (pid)

```
https://www.swatch.com/en-us/turner-s-scarlet-sunset-so28z700/SO28Z700.html
```
Here, `SO28Z700` is the Product ID.
